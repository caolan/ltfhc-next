![The Mouse Pointer is a white arrow on the Laptop's screen.](img/mouse-cursor-icon.jpg)

It helps you to use the Laptop by pointing at buttons, menus and other part of the screen. You can move the Pointer in 2 different ways:

1. Using the Pointing stick
2. Using the Trackpad



Try both the Pointing stick and the Trackpad for a few minutes and choose the one you feel most comfortable with. Both will take a little bit of time to get used to,

####The Pointing Stick

![](img/hp_elite_trackpoint.png)

The pointing stick helps you move the Pointer on the screen. 

The pointing stick is in the middle of the Laptop's keyboard between letters G and H. To use it you need to place your fingertip on the pointing stick and nudge it. The white Pointer will move on the screen in the direction you nudge the pointing stick.

To activate something on the screen (like pressing a button, selecting a box to input text, or choosing a menu item) you need to position your Pointer where you want and then use the Left Button (or sometimes the Right button) to activate.

#Troubleshooting information

###Introduction

####How does the Healthcare System work?



![](img/workflowdiagram.png)



1. The Healthcare Worker accesses the Healthcare System using a Laptop. 
2. The Healthcare Worker uses the Chrome Browser on the Laptop to use the Healthcare System. 
3. The Laptop connects to the Server via WiFi. WiFi allows the Healthcare Worker to move the Laptop away from the Server and still be connected to the Healthcare System. 
4. The Healthcare Data is located on the Server, this means that the Data is securely stored on the Server and is not stored on the Laptop. The Laptop simply allows authorized Healthcare Workers to use the Data that is on the Server.
5. The Healthcare System is connected with other Healthcare Systems around the Lake using Radio signals. This allows the Healthcare Data to be shared with other Clinics around the Lake. The Radio can also be used to contact Healthcare workers that are in other Clinics around the Lake. To connect to other Healthcare Systems, the Server uses a Modem connected to a Radio.

####Getting Started

####How to keep the Healthcare System powered?

 

####Solar Panel and Battery

The Solar Panel needs to be connected to the Battery which will store the electricity. The Solar Panel needs to be oriented towards the sun so that it can charge the battery during the day when the sun is out. 

Connecting all power cables to the Solar Panel and Battery

Everything needs to be connected to power sources to function. 


####What to do if there is no power?

####What to do if the computer doesn't start?

####What to do if the Healthcare System doesn't start?



If it does not start, make sure that the address bar has the text:
<blockquote>
http://www.health
</blockquote>
like so:

![](img/www.healthurl.png)



* eth0 is always 172.16.99.1
* eth1 is DHCP-acquired
* wlan0 broadcasts hostapd, showing up as NETWORK SSID 'clinic'
* the password for 'clinic' is hoffman medic platelet crutch
* the web url for the health interface is http://www.health
* The Google Chrome browser is set to open http://www.health as its default page when the application is launched.
* The antenna order from left to right is GPS, 3G, Wi-Fi.
* the admin user and passwords are lastmile / lastmile123



In the event of problems first diagnose the problem.

If the problem appears to be a power problem (no lights) check the power connections at the silver micro-server, voltage regulator, 4-way junction, and solar controller. Check connections from the solar panel to the solar controller. Check power at the solar panel and at the battery.

If the problem appears to be a radio problem, make sure the antenna connections are made securely.
