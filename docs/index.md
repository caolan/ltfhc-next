# Electronic Medical Records documentation!

The Electronic Medical Records system is a software and hardware system which can be deployed in ultra-rural areas. The system is piloted currently in Tanzania. The LTFHC EMR System fills several gaps in existing Healthcare solutions for ultra-rural areas:

  - It is a Medical Record system meant to be used by Community Health Workers. (Other solutions focus on reporting rather than Medical Records which is an integral part of ensuring quality health care delivery).
  - It is a workstation solution, not a mobile solution. It is designed to be used by Health Workers during a consultation and therefore uses the full screen and keyboard of a laptop and browser interface.
  - It is also a flexible Reporting solution. It provides a flexible and easy to use reporting system which can be adapted to different Health administration's reporting constraints. It uses HF Radio for data transmission, and is therefore able to operate in areas which are not covered by mobile phone infrastructure, and without costs for data transmission.

In addition, the EMR System's hardware components is currently based on off the shelf components, and iilab is aiming at developing a low cost solution using an open hardware approach. The software component of the system is available as open source.
